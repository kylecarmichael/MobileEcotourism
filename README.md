# MobileEcotourism
Single Page static site made for an ENG 102 project.
Built with HTML CSS and Bootstrap.

While taking ENG 102 at Arizona State University, I had to create a kind of poster or single sheet to highlight an issue I had researched.
For practice in building static pages, I decided to create a webpage for my project.

Mobile Alabama is the location focus while the CTA is to designate more space to be reserved for the diverse ecosystem.
